    "* Object Oriented Programming is a Computer Programming model or a Paradigm that organizes software design around data or objects rather than functions and logic.\n",
    "* An Object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour.\n",
    "* Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.\n",
    "* One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is know as Object Oriented Programming.\n",
    "* An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "    1. Attributes\n",
    "    2. Behaviour\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The Concept of OOP in Python focuses on reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Example**    \n",
    "* A Person or a Bird can be an object as it has the following properties\n",
    "    1. name, age, color as Attributes\n",
    "    2. singing, dancing as Behaviour"

    "## Advantages of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplicity:** software objects model real world objects, so the complexity is reduced and the program structure is very clear.\n",
    "* **Modularity:** each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other parts of the system. \n",
    "* **Modifiability:** it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external world has to a class is through the use of methods. \n",
    "* **Extensibility:** adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few new objects and modifying some existing ones. \n",
    "* **Maintainability:** objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier. \n",
    "* **Re-usability:** objects can be reused in different programs"
